Unity Tutorial for building a shooter game

This game's priority was to to understand how prefabs can be used to implement a shooting mechanic into a 2D game.

Based on the Space Shooter game from "Unity 2020 By Example" by Robert Wells.
Additional help was taken from the Brackeys Youtube page. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKsl1Mfp5M
